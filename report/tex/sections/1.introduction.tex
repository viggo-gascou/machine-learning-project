Image processing is a broad field in the world of deep learning. 
It is applied in various ways, in everything from self-driving 
cars to filters on your phone.
An image is generally represented as a matrix, where each entry is 
a pixel-value indicating the intensity of colour in that spot. 
There are numerous ways to classify an image, and amongst those, 
the most popular ones are convolutional neural networks.

The goal of this project is to implement different machine 
learning models that are able to classify grey-scale images from 
the popular Fashion MNIST data set from Zalando 
\autocite{xiao2017/online}. Through this report we will present 
the implementations and evaluate our models and discuss the 
sources of error that occured.
