Out of the three classification models we used for this task, we 
found that the convolutional neural network achieved the best 
results. The model performed with an accuracy of $87\%$ on unseen 
test data, which is a reasonable result given that we encountered 
problems such as class overlap. The model could be improved with a 
more in-depth examination of the architecture, while the use of 
ensemble methods involving multiple models could also be explored for the purpose of improving classification performance.
