# machine-learning-project
Repo for storing our machine learning project

To start using the library simply run from the github root directory

```sh
pip install .
```

Or if you want to edit or add anything you can install the library in editable mode, so you don't have to reinstall after each change:

```sh
pip install -e .
```
