# Machine Learning Project

Repository for storing our machine learning project

The aim of this project was to implement a Feedforward Neural Network as well as a Decision Tree from scratch using only [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [scikit-learn preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=preprocessing#module-sklearn.preprocessing) tools. 

Then use these models for classification on a subset of the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
