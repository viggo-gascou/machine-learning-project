# Installation

## Normal installation

To start using the library simply run the following command from the root of the github repository directory

``` sh
pip install .
```

## Development installation

If you want to edit or add anything to the library you can install the library in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html#development-mode-a-k-a-editable-installs), so you don't have to reinstall the library after each change:

``` sh
pip install -e .
```
